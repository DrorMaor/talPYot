# Project Title

Davening angle to the Kosel from any named place on Earth.

## Description

talPYot is a Python package that provides the davening angle to the Kosel, from any given named location on Earth.
The name is derived from the word Talpiot, which the Gemora Berachos 30a references.
The Gemora says that wherever you are davening, you must face in the direction of the Kosel. Then the Gemora quotes the source to this:
